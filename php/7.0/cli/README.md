PHPDocker.io - PHP 7.0 / CLI container image
=============================================

## DEPRECATED

This image is now deprecated due to EOL reached on this PHP version. Daily builds are kept as Ubuntu may still publish security updates until Xenial EOL in 2021

**Do not use in production**

Ubuntu Xenial PHP 7.0 CLI container image for [PHPDocker.io](http://phpdocker.io) projects.

Smaller in size than PHP's official container (190MB vs 501MB) plus you don't need to install any build dependencies let alone compile anything, Ubuntu Xenial already provide with the right packages.
