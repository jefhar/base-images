PHPDocker.io - PHP 7.1 / CLI container image
=============================================

## DEPRECATED

This image is now deprecated and not built daily due to EOL reached on both PHP and the
base image OS (Debian Jessie).

**Do not use in production**

Ubuntu 16.04 PHP 7.1 CLI container image for [PHPDocker.io](http://phpdocker.io) projects. Packages are provided by [Ondřej Surý](https://deb.sury.org/).

Smaller in size than PHP's official container 200MB vs 501MB) plus you don't need to install any build dependencies let alone compile anything, Dotdeb already ship binaries for the vast majority, if not all, of PHP extensions available on PHP7.
